// Objects

/*Disambiguation

container: that which holds something with substance, NOT to be confused with the substance itself
-Much in the same way that with a glass of water, you do not confuse the glass with the water and vice versa

value: the substance/data
-As a book is to words, arithmetic is to plus/minus, the relationship between a value and container is interdependant

property: a value



terminology continued-
variable: a container for values/data
object: a container that holds multiple values
-Objects have properties(values) and actions(methods)
-Objects pretty much self-contained variable/function duos?

let x= 'Hello'
let y= 'Bonjour'
console.log(y)
The above: var x is called to be displayed onto the console. Its 'property' or 'value' is then presented
